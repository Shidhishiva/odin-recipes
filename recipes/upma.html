    <h1>Upma-Recipe</h1>
    <img src="/Users/shidhi/repos/odin-recipes/images/Upma.jpg" alt="Upma-Picture">
    <p>Upma is a popular South Indian breakfast made with cream of wheat or semolina flour (called rava or suji locally), veggies, spices and herbs. 
        The upma recipe I share here is adapted from my momâ€™s recipe and continues to be a favorite in my home.
        The ingredients used to flavor the rava upma (also called suji ka upma) give it a deliciously satisfying taste that will make this dish one of your new preferred go-to breakfasts.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rava/Semolina/Sooji: I have used a fine variety of sooji in this recipe. 
            You can also use coarse variety. Semolina is available in Indian grocery stores.</li>
        <li>Oil: Use any cooking oil. </li>
        <li>Mustard seeds, cumin, urad dal & chana dal: added for tempering.</li>
        <li>Cashews: added for crunch and taste. It's optional.</li>
        <li>Green chilies: I have used 2 Thai green chilies.</li>
        <li>Curry leaves: added to enhance the flavor.</li>
        <li>Ginger: use minced or grated ginger.</li>
        <li>Hing (Asafoetida): used for flavoring. You can also use gluten-free asafoetida.</li>
        <li>Onion: I have used finely chopped onions.</li>
        <li>Milk: adding milk enhances the flavor of the upma, however, you can skip and replace it with water</li>
        <li>Lemon juice: freshly squeezed lemon juice tastes the best.</li>
        <li>Garnish: use freshly chopped coriander leaves.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by roasting the sooji along with one teaspoon of cumin (jeera) until it's fragrant on a medium-low flame in a pan</li>
        <li>Add oil to a heavy bottom pan, add mustard seeds, chana dal, urad dal, and cashew nuts, and saute for 1 minute until they change color.</li>
        <li>Next, add chopped ginger, green chilies, asafetida, and curry leaves. Saute another 20 secs.</li>
        <li>Next, add water, milk and let the water come to a boil. Do not add salt directly at this stage; milk will curdle.</li>
        <li>Once the water & milk comes to a boil, add salt, and start adding the (roasted sooji + jeera) a little at a time. Stir continuously after each addition in one direction with a spatula to avoid lumps.</li>
        <li>Then cover the pan with the lid and set the heat to low. Let it remain like that for 2-3 mins until the moisture gets absorbed. Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Remove lid, add lemon juice, coriander leaves, and two tablespoons of ghee. Ghee is optional but recommended. Mix well</li>
        
    </ol>
